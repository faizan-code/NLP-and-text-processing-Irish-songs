# NLP-and-text-processing-Irish-songs

1) In this project I have done NLP and Text Processing from an Irish Song.

2) I have used TensorFlow for making my model You can get the data set from the collab notebook I have uploaded.

3) The model uses Bidirectional LSTM  and is trained with 100 Epochs with max accuracy of 82.5% you can use my code and change the epochs or data set according to your preferences.

4) I have also use matplotlib to plot the graph of Traning accuracy and loss with change is Epochs.
